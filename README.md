# CSharp-Reference
## Purpose
I created this project to demonstrate how **I personally choose** to utilize C# to create project structures that I have been successful with.  
The purpose is to find implemenations in other languages that mimic the function, but not necessary the form.

## Noteworty Items
### Spring Framework
Spring Framework for .Net has been used to provide basic IoC services as well as AOP services.  Basic retry and logging aspects are used to demonstrate how I choose to accomplish some of these tasks.
